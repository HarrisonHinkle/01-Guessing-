# 01-Guessing-
First project for Game Technology

The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 20, the program tells the player if they are right, allows them to guess again, and keeps count of how many guesses the player gave before finding the correct number. It also allows the player to try agian after getting the correct answer and keeps track of the shortest number of attempts it took the player to find the answer.
